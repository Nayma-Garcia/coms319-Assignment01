A webpage about our Minecraft world called Walmart2714

It includes the following webpages which use bootstrap templates as the base:

- Index.html Page
  - The main webpage you see when you open the website. It just has a picture of our world with its name
  - Also if you click on the big minecraft logo on the top of every page it takes you back to this page
  
- About us Page:
  - This webpage just talks a little bit about us (the makers of the website, Justin and Nayma) and shows our minecraft characters
  
- The Lore Page:
  - This page is just for fun, it talks about the history of our world and everything thats happened in it since we've made it along with some  of the    
    other people we play with.
    
- H&M Store Page:
  - This page is where our catalog of products is. It has a picture of the store we built in our world and then the catalog of products which is the          
    different things we "sell" in the store.
    Item pages:
      - if you click on an item you are taken to a page that has more pictures of the item along with a full outfit with the item. It also has a small 
        description of the item and how much it costs and how you can only buy it in the store in our world.
